## Basics of C Programming

### What is C?
C is a **procedural, middle-level programming language** developed by **Dennis Ritchie**.

### Why is C called a middle-level language?
Because it supports **both high-level features** (loops, functions) and **low-level features** (pointers, memory access).

### What are keywords?
Keywords are **reserved words** with predefined meaning.  
Example: `int`, `if`, `while`, `return`

---

## Data Types

### Types of data types in C?
- Primary: `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`
- Derived: array, pointer
- User-defined: structure, union, enum

### What is typecasting?
Conversion of one data type into another.

---

## Operators

### What are operators?
Symbols used to **perform operations on variables**.

### Difference between `=` and `==`?
- `=` → assignment  
- `==` → comparison  

---

## Control Statements

### What is a loop?
Used to **execute a block of code repeatedly**.

### Types of loops in C?
- for  
- while  
- do-while  

### Difference between while and do-while?
- while checks condition first  
- do-while executes at least once  

---

## Functions

### What is a function?
A block of code that **performs a specific task**.

### What is recursion?
When a function **calls itself**.

---

## Arrays & Strings

### What is an array?
A collection of **same type elements stored in contiguous memory**.

### What is a string?
An array of characters terminated by **`\0`**.

---

## Pointers

### What is a pointer?
A variable that **stores the address of another variable**.

### What is a NULL pointer?
A pointer that **points to no valid memory location**.

---

## Structures & Unions

### What is a structure?
A user-defined data type that groups **different data types**.

### Structure vs Union
- Structure → separate memory  
- Union → shared memory  

---

## File Handling

### What is file handling?
Used to **store data permanently** in files.

### Common file functions
`fopen()`, `fclose()`, `fprintf()`, `fscanf()`

---

## Dynamic Memory Allocation

### What is DMA?
Memory allocated **at runtime** using  
`malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, `free()`

---

## Common Viva Questions

### What is a header file?
Contains **function declarations** (e.g., `stdio.h`).

### What is a compiler?
Converts **source code into machine code**.

### What is segmentation fault?
Occurs due to **invalid memory access**.
